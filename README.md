# Notice
This repository is created for the paper "AutoP2C: An LLM-Based Agent Framework for Code Repository Generation from Multimodal Content in Academic Papers." In this paper, we focus on how to automatically generate a code repository for an academic paper with multimodal content and call it the ``Paper-to-Code'' (P2C) task,as shown in Figure 1.

Specifically, given a research paper containing heterogeneous, multimodal content, P2C aims to generate a complete executable code repository that accurately implements the described methods and reproduces the reported results.
We have now released an initial version of the code. You can have a try by following the steps.  

You can first translate the paper using MinerU and put the transformed paper content under markdown_files/paper.md. Then, execute the run.sh.
